    <h2>Inferno, The First Book</h2>
    <p> Midway upon the journey of our life 
        I found myself within a forest dark,<br><br> 
        For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
        
        Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say<br><br> 
        What was this forest savage, rough, and stern, 
        Which in the very thought renews the fear. <br><br>
        
        So bitter is it, death is little more; 
        But of the good to treat, which there I found, 
        Speak will I of the other things I saw there.<br><br>
        
        I cannot well repeat how there I entered, 
        So full was I of slumber at the moment 
        In which I had abandoned the true way.<br><br>
        
        But after I had reached a mountain's foot, 
        At that point where the valley terminated, 
        Which had with consternation pierced my heart,<br><br>
        
        Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders, 
        Vested already with that planet's rays 
        Which leadeth others right by every road.<br><br>
        
        Then was the fear a little quieted 
        That in my heart's lake had endured throughout 
        The night, which I had passed so piteously.<br><br>
        
        And even as he, who, with distressful breath, 
        Forth issued from the sea upon the shore, 
        Turns to the water perilous and gazes;<br><br> 
        
        So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward, 
        Turn itself back to re-behold the pass 
        Which never yet a living person left.</p>
